LOOK FOR THE MAIN IDEA FROM THE PARAGRAPHS BELOW.
1.	Summer is a wonderful time to spend at West Beach. It is a beach with light- colored, soft sand. The coastline goes on for a long way and many people enjoy walking along it. Children like to play in the surf and walk along the rocks that are visible at low tide. This is a fun beach for people of all ages.

2.	The movie Apollo 13 was a blockbuster for the summer of 1995. It is an exciting story about space exploration. In the movie, the astronauts get in trouble while they are trying to return to Earth. People in the audience are on the edge of their seats waiting to see what happens. What makes it even more exciting is that it is a true story.

3.	Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are a number of things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job-shadow”, in which you spend a day with a person who is working in a field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.

4.	The United States seems to be in love with the idea of going out to eat. Because of this, a real variety of restaurants has come about specializing in all kinds of foods. McDonald’s is the king of a subgroup of restaurants called fast-food restaurants. Chances are, no matter where you live, there is a McDonald’s restaurant near you. There are even McDonald’s in the Soviet Union. Now McDonald’s is trying something new. It is called McDonald’s Express and there is a test site in Peabody, Massachusetts. It is part of a Mobil gas station. This allows you to fill up with gas and fill up on food at the same time. What will they think of next?

                                            Make some expressions of compliment to J.K Rowling! 
J.K Rowling conceived the idea of Harry Potter during a train ride in 1990. By the time she finished writing it seven years later, her mother died, she divorced and lived in near poverty. And her book was rejected by 12 publishers. What is so remarkably inspiring about Rowlings’ story is that despite living in near poverty and despite being rejected 12 times – she persisted with her dream to tell the world a story about the magical life of Harry Potter.
She is now a billionaire, the first author to become one. Her fantastically original story is now a household name with blockbuster movies, theme parks, and even a wildly popular fan-based podcast called MuggleCast. In her most painful moments living just above poverty, Rowling might not have been able to see the empire she’d soon create. But she did see her story and it moved her. Despite the many difficult circumstances she faced at the time – she channeled her pain to create an even better story.</a>

                                            JAKARTA CREATIVE INDUSTRIES
I read such an interesting article about the 'beauty and diversity' of Jakarta's museums in The Jakarta
Post Magazine's The Museum Week edition. For that reason, I was inclined to share my personal
experience of Jakarta's art and creative scene. I think that Jakarta's art and creative scene is so slim
that a proposal to UNESCO excluded Jakarta from its list of creative cities. According to the proposal, Bandung, Pekalongan, Surakarta, and Yogyakarta are on the list of creative
cities. What did I learn from the absence of Jakarta? It is easier to find malls, blockbuster Hollywood
movies, and traffic jams in Jakarta than inspiring spaces, like musical concerts, animation film festivals,
and batik fashion shows. A friend advised me to visit Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. I was so surprised that L could not speak a
word. I enjoyed the textile and puppet museums. I also caught Indonesian movies. I was so impressed
that I to buy more books about this country, I think Indonesia is such a potential country that creative
industries develop well. I also see that Jakarta also offers cultural celebrations to enjoy, but they all emphasize Betawi culture. Jakarta is a place where people from Aceh to Papua go. These people surely bring their cultures and
traditions to metropolitan Jakarta. These diverse cultures can promote creative industries in Jakarta
with the support of the government and investors. I am sure that encouragement and funding is required to empower the citizens of Jakarta to reap
economic benefits from creative industries directly and transparently. The melting pot of creativity in
Jakarta has the potential to help not only the lives of Jakartans, but also the economy of Indonesia as a
whole. (Bentley, 2013)

This is the place to find all your favorite Disney characters and attractions. Then, Epcot is divided into two areas: Future World and World Showcase.

There are also a number of exciting rides and attractions based on blockbuster movies, which provide fascinating stunts and amazing special effects. The newest and largest is Animal Kingdom, a 500-acre park that is divided into three areas: The Real, The Mythical and The Extinct. The Real area features live animals in exotic landscapes and provides a safari-like experience. In The Mythical area, guests come face-to-face with magical and make believe creatures. In the Extinct Area, dinosaurs come to life. Compared to any other Disney's resorts such as Disneyland California, Disneyland Paris or the new Disneyland Tokyo, Disney World in Orlando, Florida is still the best. All other Disney resorts consist of a single theme park and are quite small compared to the massive resort complex in Florida. This resort is referred as Disney World or Walt Disney World. The other parks are usually called Disneyland. The size and diversity of the Disney World resort ensures that it will probably remain the number one vacation destination in the world for years to come. 44. The text mostly tells the readers ....

                                            Jakarta's Creative Industries I read such an interesting article about the beauty and diversity of Jakarta's museums in The Jakarta Post Magazine's The Museum Week edition. For that reason, I was inclined to of share my personal experience Jakarta's art and creative scene. I think that Jakarta's art and creative scene is so slim that a proposal to UNESCO excluded Jakarta from its list of creative cities. T Reza Syathin/Shutterstock. According to the proposal, Bandung, Pekalongan, Surakarta, and Yogyakarta are on the list of creative cities. What did I learn from the absence of Jakarta? It is easier to find malls, blockbuster Hollywood movies, and traffic jams in Jakarta than inspiring spaces, like musical concerts, animation film festivals, and batik fashion shows. A friend advised me to visit Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. I was so surprised that I could not speak a word. I enjoyed the textile and puppet​</a>

                                            b.	What is the topic sentence of each paragraph?
1)	Carpeting may initially be less expensive than installing hardwood floors. While carpeting may look fantastic when it is first laid, in a relatively short period of time, it can become badly soiled. If the carpet is not cleaned regularly, these stains can permanently mar its beauty. Once this happens, the only recourse is to replace the stained carpet with a new one. In the end, then, hardwood flooring is a better buy than carpeting.

2)	Can the common cold be cured?  For centuries humans have sought ways to alleviate the discomfort associated with this minor illness, trying everything from special baths to special healing stones.   Today, thanks to a focused research effort, science is beginning to make headway in finding a cure. Doctors are able to replicate the cold and small steps have been made in producing medicine which can at least reduce the time people must endure the effects of this disease.

3)	Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are a number of things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job-shadow”, in which you spend a day with a person who is working in a field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.

4)	The movie Apollo 13 was a blockbuster for the summer of 1995. It is an exciting story about space exploration. In the movie, the astronauts get in trouble while they are trying to return to Earth. People in the audience are on the edge of their seats waiting to see what happens. What makes it even more exciting is that it is a true story.

5)	Growing a garden can be fun, good exercise, and will provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.

                                             Read the following text loudly to improve your reading skill and answer the questions. Several Things to Do if You Visit Toronto, Canada There are several must-have experience that you should do if you visit Toronto, Canada. If you visit Toronto Canada, do the following things as follows. 1. CN Tower's Edge Walk If you come to Toronto City, it will give you the opportunity to break records by completing the world's highest full circle hands-free walk on a 5 ft wide ledge encircling the top of the CN Tower's main pod, which is 356m/1,168 ft (116 storeys) above the ground. If you also have a few spare hours and you're in the area, make sure you walk across to Ripley's Aquarium which is located next to the CN Tower entrance. With over 16,000 aquatic animals, there's plenty to see and do whatever your age. 2. Toronto Heli Tours If you don't fancy dangling yourself off the edge off a ridiculously tall building anytime soon, you can also see Toronto from 2,000 feet up in a helicopter. The city has recently started offering people the chance to do the Heli Tour, which shows you all off the best landmarks downtown, as well as giving you the chance to go right up to the Edge Walk and give all the thrill seekers a little wave if you feel the need. If you're not quite brave enough to do the Edge Walk, definitely give this one a whirl - you won't regret it. 3. Dundas Square Dundas Square is one of the most touristy areas in the city, but it's also one of the areas that you're most likely to recognize from the big screen. With Dundas Square being incredibly similar to New York's Times Square, it is very often used for blockbuster movies because it's a lot easier to film in. In fact, not only has the Square been used as a major location, but the whole of Toronto can very often be seen in big budget films. The Incredible Hulk, Total Recall, Hairspray, Robocop and Suicide Squad are all examples. If you fancy grabbing a bite to eat while in the area, make sure you check out Lena Restaurante, which is an Argentinean eatery that offers an array of small plates which are perfect to sharebantu translate dong​</a>

1.	Summer is a wonderful time to spend at West Beach. It is a beach with light- colored, soft sand. The coastline goes on for a long way and many people enjoy walking along it. Children like to play in the surf and walk along the rocks that are visible at low tide. This is a fun beach for people of all ages.

3.	Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are a number of things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job-shadow”, in which you spend a day with a person who is working in a field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.

4.	The United States seems to be in love with the idea of going out to eat. Because of this, a real variety of restaurants has come about specializing in all kinds of foods. McDonald’s is the king of a subgroup of restaurants called fast-food restaurants. Chances are, no matter where you live, there is a McDonald’s restaurant near you. There are even McDonald’s in the Soviet Union. Now McDonald’s is trying something new. It is called McDonald’s Express and there is a test site in Peabody, Massachusetts. It is part of a Mobil gas station. This allows you to fill up with gas and fill up on food at the same time. What will they think of next?

                            7. Make some expressions of compliment to J.K Rowling! 
J.K Rowling conceived the idea of Harry Potter during a train ride in 1990. By the time she finished writing it seven years later, her mother died, she divorced and lived in near poverty. And her book was rejected by 12 publishers. What is so remarkably inspiring about Rowlings’ story is that despite living in near poverty and despite being rejected 12 times – she persisted with her dream to tell the world a story about the magical life of Harry Potter.
She is now a billionaire, the first author to become one. Her fantastically original story is now a household name with blockbuster movies, theme parks, and even a wildly popular fan-based podcast called MuggleCast. In her most painful moments living just above poverty, Rowling might not have been able to see the empire she’d soon create. But she did see her story and it moved her. Despite the many difficult circumstances she faced at the time – she channeled her pain to create an even better story.</h2><br />

                            8. JAKARTA CREATIVE INDUSTRIES
I read such an interesting article about the 'beauty and diversity' of Jakarta's museums in The Jakarta
Post Magazine's The Museum Week edition. For that reason, I was inclined to share my personal
experience of Jakarta's art and creative scene. I think that Jakarta's art and creative scene is so slim
that a proposal to UNESCO excluded Jakarta from its list of creative cities. According to the proposal, Bandung, Pekalongan, Surakarta, and Yogyakarta are on the list of creative
cities. What did I learn from the absence of Jakarta? It is easier to find malls, blockbuster Hollywood
movies, and traffic jams in Jakarta than inspiring spaces, like musical concerts, animation film festivals,
and batik fashion shows. A friend advised me to visit Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. I was so surprised that L could not speak a
word. I enjoyed the textile and puppet museums. I also caught Indonesian movies. I was so impressed
that I to buy more books about this country, I think Indonesia is such a potential country that creative
industries develop well. I also see that Jakarta also offers cultural celebrations to enjoy, but they all emphasize Betawi culture. Jakarta is a place where people from Aceh to Papua go. These people surely bring their cultures and
traditions to metropolitan Jakarta. These diverse cultures can promote creative industries in Jakarta
with the support of the government and investors. I am sure that encouragement and funding is required to empower the citizens of Jakarta to reap
economic benefits from creative industries directly and transparently. The melting pot of creativity in
Jakarta has the potential to help not only the lives of Jakartans, but also the economy of Indonesia as a
whole. (Bentley, 2013)

Walt Disney World or simply known as Disney World is located near Orlando, Florida. It has been assumed as the original Disneyland and considered as the iconic American entertainment destination. A statue of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse in front of Cinderella's Castle welcomes you. It is certainly the most-visited entertainment resort on earth, with an annual attendance of about 47 million people. It is also the largest, covering 30,080 acres or 47 square miles, twice the size of Manhattan. The resort is comprised of multiple parks, each with a unique theme. Magic Kingdom, the first theme park built at the resort, has rides, shows and attractions divided among seven fantasy areas. This is the place to find all your favorite Disney characters and attractions. Then, Epcot is divided into two areas: Future World and World Showcase. The attractions in Future World are based on modem and futuristic advances in communication, transportation, energy, agriculture and much more. World Showcase allows you to explore culture, cuisine, shopping and entertainment from many countries. At Epcot you can travel around the world without leaving the resort. The Disney-MGM Studios offers behind-the-scenes looks at the making of movies and popular TV shows and provides live original shows. There are also a number of exciting rides and attractions based on blockbuster movies, which provide fascinating stunts and amazing special effects. The newest and largest is Animal Kingdom, a 500-acre park that is divided into three areas: The Real, The Mythical and The Extinct. The Real area features live animals in exotic landscapes and provides a safari-like experience. In The Mythical area, guests come face-to-face with magical and make believe creatures. In the Extinct Area, dinosaurs come to life. Compared to any other Disney's resorts such as Disneyland California, Disneyland Paris or the new Disneyland Tokyo, Disney World in Orlando, Florida is still the best. All other Disney resorts consist of a single theme park and are quite small compared to the massive resort complex in Florida. This resort is referred as Disney World or Walt Disney World.

1)	Carpeting may initially be less expensive than installing hardwood floors. While carpeting may look fantastic when it is first laid, in a relatively short period of time, it can become badly soiled. If the carpet is not cleaned regularly, these stains can permanently mar its beauty. Once this happens, the only recourse is to replace the stained carpet with a new one. In the end, then, hardwood flooring is a better buy than carpeting.

2)	Can the common cold be cured?  For centuries humans have sought ways to alleviate the discomfort associated with this minor illness, trying everything from special baths to special healing stones.   Today, thanks to a focused research effort, science is beginning to make headway in finding a cure. Doctors are able to replicate the cold and small steps have been made in producing medicine which can at least reduce the time people must endure the effects of this disease.

It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.

                            14.  Read the following text loudly to improve your reading skill and answer the questions. Several Things to Do if You Visit Toronto, Canada There are several must-have experience that you should do if you visit Toronto, Canada. If you visit Toronto Canada, do the following things as follows. 1. CN Tower's Edge Walk If you come to Toronto City, it will give you the opportunity to break records by completing the world's highest full circle hands-free walk on a 5 ft wide ledge encircling the top of the CN Tower's main pod, which is 356m/1,168 ft (116 storeys) above the ground. If you also have a few spare hours and you're in the area, make sure you walk across to Ripley's Aquarium which is located next to the CN Tower entrance. With over 16,000 aquatic animals, there's plenty to see and do whatever your age. 2. Toronto Heli Tours If you don't fancy dangling yourself off the edge off a ridiculously tall building anytime soon, you can also see Toronto from 2,000 feet up in a helicopter. The city has recently started offering people the chance to do the Heli Tour, which shows you all off the best landmarks downtown, as well as giving you the chance to go right up to the Edge Walk and give all the thrill seekers a little wave if you feel the need. If you're not quite brave enough to do the Edge Walk, definitely give this one a whirl - you won't regret it. 3. Dundas Square Dundas Square is one of the most touristy areas in the city, but it's also one of the areas that you're most likely to recognize from the big screen. With Dundas Square being incredibly similar to New York's Times Square, it is very often used for blockbuster movies because it's a lot easier to film in. In fact, not only has the Square been used as a major location, but the whole of Toronto can very often be seen in big budget films. The Incredible Hulk, Total Recall, Hairspray, Robocop and Suicide Squad are all examples.

Beberapa Hal yang Harus Dilakukan Jika Anda Mengunjungi Toronto, Kanada Ada beberapa pengalaman yang harus Anda lakukan jika Anda mengunjungi Toronto, Kanada. Jika Anda berkunjung ke Toronto Kanada, lakukan hal-hal berikut ini. 1. CN Tower's Edge Walk Jika Anda datang ke Toronto City, ini akan memberi Anda kesempatan untuk memecahkan rekor dengan menyelesaikan jalan bebas genggam lingkaran penuh tertinggi di dunia di langkan selebar 5 kaki yang mengelilingi bagian atas pod utama Menara CN, yang adalah 356m/1.168 kaki (116 lantai) di atas tanah. Jika Anda juga memiliki waktu luang dan berada di area tersebut, pastikan Anda berjalan menyeberang ke Ripley's Aquarium yang terletak di sebelah pintu masuk CN Tower. Dengan lebih dari 16.000 hewan air, ada banyak hal untuk dilihat dan dilakukan berapa pun usia Anda. 2. Tur Heli Toronto Jika Anda tidak suka menggantung diri di tepi gedung yang sangat tinggi dalam waktu dekat, Anda juga dapat melihat Toronto dari ketinggian 2.000 kaki dengan helikopter. Kota ini baru-baru ini mulai menawarkan kesempatan kepada orang-orang untuk melakukan Tur Heli, yang menunjukkan kepada Anda semua landmark terbaik di pusat kota, serta memberi Anda kesempatan untuk langsung naik ke Edge Walk dan memberikan gelombang kecil kepada semua pencari sensasi jika Anda merasa perlu. Jika Anda tidak cukup berani untuk melakukan Edge Walk, cobalah yang ini - Anda tidak akan menyesalinya. 3. Dundas Square Dundas Square adalah salah satu area paling turis di kota, tetapi juga salah satu area yang paling mungkin Anda kenali dari layar lebar. Dengan Dundas Square yang sangat mirip dengan Times Square New York, ini sangat sering digunakan untuk film blockbuster karena jauh lebih mudah untuk difilmkan. Faktanya, Square tidak hanya digunakan sebagai lokasi utama, tetapi seluruh Toronto dapat sangat sering terlihat di film anggaran besar. The Incredible Hulk, Total Recall, Hairspray, Robocop, dan Suicide Squad adalah contohnya. Jika Anda ingin makan saat berada di area tersebut, pastikan Anda mengunjungi Lena Restaurante, restoran Argentina yang menawarkan berbagai piring kecil yang sempurna untuk dibagikan.</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><p>cuma perlu translate kan?</p><p></p><br />
